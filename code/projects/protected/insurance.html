    		<p class="">This insurance industry client had an existing Wordpress site and member-only portal. As the sole designer I identified UX and content strategy improvements and produced high-fidelity comps. The new designs targeted areas where research and analytics showed users were dropping off or had to contact the client for help.</p>

			<h2><span class="port-number">.01</span>Wordpress Site</h2>
			<h3 class=>Calculators</h3>
			<p class="pt-2">The first product I began working on for this client was  their wordpress-based .org site. Used both as a sales opportunity for future customers and a launchpad for existing members, this site had a wide user base.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-12 mb-5 p-std pt-0">
			<p class="">One of the main tools used for reaching future customers are the interactive calculators on the site. They help site visitors understand their ideal insurance coverage and predict their rates. Although already popular on the site, I saw an opportunity to reach more users by improving the usability of the tools.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-12">

		</div>	 
		<div class="col-12 m-5 p-std ">
			<p class="">My solution included streamlining the tool by moving the form fields to a single column. This approach minimizes the amount of time a user has to spend understanding the form and follows best practices for usability.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-12">
			<img class="img-fluid mb-5" alt="printed brochure of research for next step go" src="../../Images/insurance/Calculator-New.png">
		</div>	 
		<div class="col-12 p-std">
			<p class="pb-5">The other major issue with this tool was that the outputs displayed beneath the form, so the user had to scroll to find their recommended coverage. There was no indication that new information was appearing on the page.</p>		
			<p class="">I moved the coverage output to appear next the calculator, which sets expectations for where to expect the output. Without having to scroll back and forth, users can explore how changing life circumstances could affect their coverage needs.</p>

		<div class="col-12 p-std">
			<h3>Form Component System</h3>
			<p>As an insurance provider, this client had a variety of forms across their site. However, there was no consistent design and content guidance linking the forms, leading to inconsistencies in the experience.</p>

			<img class="img-fluid mb-5" alt="printed brochure of research for next step go" src="../../Images/insurance/formdesignsystem.png">

		<div class="col-12 p-std">
			<p>I created a form design system with guidance for both copy and design that created a component-based approach to forms across the site. This standardized the experience and ensured all forms met WCAG standards.</p>

			<h2><span class="port-number">.02</span> Member Portal</h2>
			<p class="pt-2">In addition to the .org site, this client had a portal for their existing customers to manage their plans and communicate securely with member services.</p>
			<p class="pt-2">The biggest issue this client was having with the member portal was users dropping off before they could even complete the sign-up process. The frustrations around the signup form led to frequent calls to member services.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="row mt-5 mb-5">
		<div class="col-12 p-std">
			<h3>Sign Up Form</h3>
			<p>I immediately recognized a few areas for usability improvements. First, I broke up the form into digestable steps to stick to the best practice of only having one idea per form page.</p>
			<p>By breaking up the form into three steps I was also able to integrate a progress tracker into the form to give a visual indication of where the user was in the signup process.</p>

		<div class="col-12">
			<img class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-5" alt="printed brochure of research for next step go" src="../../Images/insurance/login.png">
		</div>
	</div>	
	<div class="row mt-5 mb-5">
		<div class="col-12 p-std">
		<p>Shortening and simplifying the signup process was a key factor in improving the drop-off rate. I heavily advocated for removing the email verification step that came early in the signup process. By removing steps where the user has to navigate away from the form, there's less likelihood that a user will abandon the form.</p>
		<p>The password requirements were another complex step that had high potential for confusion. I was able to lobby for removing the requirement for symbols which brought the password requirements from four rules to three. For the remaining requirements I improved visibility by displaying a green check next to the rules which had been met.</p>

	<div class="row mt-5 mb-5">
		<div class="col-12 p-std">
			<h3>Plan Page</h3>
			<p>As this client grew and expanded some of the current solutions in their member portal became unwieldy. Originally, plan information existed in a tab under the profile page. Since Google Analytics showed that most users were coming to the member portal to access their plan information, I decided to bubble up the plan information into its own page.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-12">
			<img class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-5" alt="printed brochure of research for next step go" src="../../Images/insurance/PlanPage.png">
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 mx-auto">
			<img class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-5" alt="printed brochure of research for next step go" src="../../Images/insurance/mPlanPage.png">
		</div>
		<div class="col-12 p-std">
			<p>The new plan page created a central location for plan information that is easy to access. This section displays the current plans a user has, and provides a high level glance at plan information. The design is flexible to accommodate this client's growing suite of products and add-ons.</p>
			<p>One of the client's key goals is increasing the interaction between their .org site and the member portal. I added in promo blocks that display additional coverage options based on the user's current coverage. These blocks link out to relevant plan information on the .org site.</p>
